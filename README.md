ABOUT
-----

VCGA is platform of audio power amplifier core circuit technology with BJT
(Bipolar Junction Transistor) as the base implementation, a sub-platform of
[MATRIX 1.4 III](https://github.com/kicader/MATRIX-1.4-III). Both VCGA and
MATRIX 1.4 III shares the principle, but of course with some differences.

SOURCE DOWNLOAD
---------------

Development source and schematic examples of VCGA can be downloaded via GITHUB
at <https://vcga.github.io/> on your personal computer via the desktop GIT
program tool or command line interface based GIT tool:

    git clone https://github.com/vcga/vcga.git

The source and schematic example bundle also available as ZIP file, can be
downloaded via general web browser or file downloader tool with URL:
<https://github.com/vcga/vcga/archive/master.zip>

SCHEMATIC EXAMPLE
-----------------

The example of schematics are available within
[schematics](https://github.com/vcga/vcga/tree/master/schematics)
folder or at:  
<https://github.com/vcga/vcga/tree/master/schematics/>

The schematic files can be viewed and edited with use
[KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) V.5.x and also available in PDF format.

Schematic example packages are available with analysis simulation support for
use with [NGSPICE](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/).
The for-simulation purposed schematic files are named with `ANALYSIS` prefix.

DOCUMENTATION & FORMULA
-----------------------

Documentation is available in web-browser viewable HTML format, can be found
within the `docs` folder and also available online as web pages at
<https://vcga.github.io/guides/index.html>
